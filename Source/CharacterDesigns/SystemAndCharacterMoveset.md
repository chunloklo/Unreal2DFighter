How do these button function in neutral/offense/defense/combos?



**Stand Light -** Mash button close. Start offense, mash from pressure

**Crouch Light -** Hits low! Check walks and grab tech attempts. Mostly offense/neutral tool (runup 6L)

**Jump Light -** Air Mash button? Faster than Jump Medium. Can do another move after it. Short recovery. Neutral/defense move.



**Stand Medium -** Ground control tool. Block>Hit button. Better spacing when cancelling into special moves. Can cancel into jump.

**Crouch Medium -** Anti-air with big hitbox. Hit>Block at medium range. Can jump cancel and can go into big damage on counter hit.



**Jump Medium -** Medium Range Air to air button. 



**Stand Heavy -** Block>Hit Move Again. Jump cancellable also. Not very rewarding on hit - lead to typical blockstring/hitstring ender with no knockdown.



**Crouch Heavy** - Sweep. No followups far away. Hit > Block
